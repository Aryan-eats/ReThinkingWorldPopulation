# Rethinking the World Population

This project explores global population trends using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python. The goal is to provide insights into how the world population has changed over time, highlight key patterns, and discuss potential implications for the future.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing of world population datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
- Visualization of population growth, distribution, and projections
- Discussion of key findings and their implications

## How to Use
1. Open the `RethinkingTheWorldPopulation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Follow the notebook cells to load data, analyze, and visualize results.
3. Modify the code to explore additional questions or datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (and other common data science libraries)

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
